## What I learned 

''' *Use thriple tickmarks to multi-line comment* '''
# Use hashtag to make single line comments. Concise and adds value. 
To test and debug, behind each line of code or variable, use ; print(variableName) 

* Use explanatory variables - name the variable on what it does/what it is, so when you read it, you know exactly itâ€™s purpose in the system.

* Use verbs for for names of functions e.g. find, calc, sum

```python
def sumArray(arr):
```
